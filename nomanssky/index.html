			<h1>About No Man's Sky</h1>
			<hr />
			
			<p>
				No Manâ€™s Sky is a space exploration game developed by Hello Games that was released in 2016. One of the primary features of the game is that the majority of the game, from the environments, spaceships, animals, plants, and planetary structures to the NPC characters and interactions are all entirely procedurally generated. According to Sean Murray, the co-founder of Hello Games, as stated in an interview with IGN, there are over 18 quintillion planets in the game, each with their own unique combination of environments, plants, animals, structures, and more (Blevins, 2014).
			</p>
			<p>
				This idea of procedurally generated worlds is one of the fundamental selling points of the game. Unlike other games which utilize procedural generation to generate new worlds to play whenever prompted, No Man's Sky works by using procedural generation in a singular universe to allow the player to explore an expansive universe seamlessly. The emphasis on procedural generation can also be seen in the trailer, as follows:

				Alongside the procedurally generated universe, the game also includes a number of storylines and quests that lead down their own paths, though these are not procedural like the environments.
