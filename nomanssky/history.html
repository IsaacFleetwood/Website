			<p>
					Hello Games first unveiled No Manâ€™s Sky during the 2013 Spike VGX awards back in December 2013 (Gaston, 2013). Immediately it attracted attention because of its emphasis that almost every part of the game was completely procedurally generated, resulting in unique planets, animals, plants, space ships, and more. Alongside this, the trailer also showcased its gameplay as an first-person, action-adventure game, showing off unique planets to explore, wrecked ships to investigate, and space battles to fight in (HelloGamesTube 2013). 
			</p>
			<h1 class="display-6">II. Release</h1>
				Upon release, the game was met with a large amount of criticism, mainly for the amount of content that was present in trailers and discussed in press released that was not present in the released game (Clayton, 2021).
			<h1 class="display-6">III. Updates</h1>
				Over time, Hello Games released new updates to No Man's Sky that added new features into the game to make it a more complete experience that fullfilled the promises set out earlier in the game's life. According to Cass Marshall, the developers at Hello Games have gained a reputation for creating excellent updates to the game, and the inspiration for many of these updates comes from fan feedback (Marshall, 2022).
