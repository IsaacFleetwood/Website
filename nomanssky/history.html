			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Hello Games first unveiled No Manâ€™s Sky during the 2013 Spike VGX awards back in December 2013 (Gaston, 2013). Immediately it attracted attention because of its emphasis that almost every part of the game was completely procedurally generated, resulting in unique planets, animals, plants, space ships, and more. Alongside this, the trailer also showcased its gameplay as an first-person, action-adventure game, showing off unique planets to explore, wrecked ships to investigate, and space battles to fight in (HelloGamesTube 2013).

				According to Parkin, a lot of hype was created for what players hoped the game would be. When Sean Murray showcased No Man's Sky at E3, the largest video gaming press conference, Parkin stated "an insatiable curse of perfectionism was in full display at this year's E3." Additionally, Parkin also stated that no release date had been given for the game, with Sean Murray saying that they will pick the date when they have a finished game (Parkin, 2015).

			<h1 class="display-6 text-light">II. Release</h1>
			<hr class="text-light" />
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Upon release however, the game was met with a large amount of criticism, mainly for the amount of content that was present in trailers and discussed in press released that was not present in the released game (Clayton, 2021). As noted by Dan Stapleton around the time of its release, the game lacked any multiplayer features outside of player-named planets. The game included a basic tutorial but failed to teach more nunanced tasks of the game, which resulted in Stapleton's review recommending player to use external guides. Stapleton praised the game's visuals and procedurally generated universe, but he additionally stated "too many other systems are badly designed and repetitive, from its basic and dull combat to its toothless survival systems, and from its unwieldy interface to its lifeless alien races." (Stapleton, 2016). As a result of this bad reception to this game, the developers worked to improve the game and consider player feedback in order to create a satisfying gameplay experience that wouldn't leave players feeling as though parts of the game were hastily implemented and thrown together.

			<h1 class="display-6 text-light">III. Updates</h1>
			<hr class="text-light" />
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Over time, Hello Games released new updates to No Man's Sky that added new features into the game to make it a more complete experience that fullfilled the promises set out earlier in the game's life. According to Cass Marshall, the developers at Hello Games gained a reputation for creating excellent updates to the game, and the inspiration for many of these updates comes from fan feedback (Marshall, 2022). In 2021, Clayton stated that No Man's Sky had crossed the threshold of reviews where the game's feedback was marked "Mostly Positive." After half a decade of updates to improve the game, most notably adding multiplayer in 2018, the game's consensus had shifted to it being a good game (Clayton, 2021).
