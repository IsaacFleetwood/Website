			<hr class="text-light" />
			
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Utilizing the individual multimedia elements that exist throughout the game, No Man’s Sky attempts to tell overarching stories that extend beyond any singular element of the game. As such, an overall analysis is needed of how elements come together into overarching narratives in the story, and how each element’s usage of multimedia comes together to complement one another and give many different perspectives to the overarching narratives.
			</p>
			
			<h1 class="display-6 text-light">I. The Atlas</h1>
			<hr class="text-light" />
			<img src="Atlas.jpg" class="w-100" alt="A picture of a space ship in space flying into a large diamond-shaped gray structure with an ominous red glowing circle in the center. The background has stars and a nearby planet." />
			<p class="w-100 fs-5 text-light">An Atlas Interface</p>
			<hr class="text-light" />

			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				The story of the Atlas is the main story being told in the main linear storyline of the game. The main storyline shows that the Atlas is a machine that simulates the universe in which the player resides, and the Atlas calls the player throughout the game as a cry for help since it determined that it only had 16 minutes to live. All of this information is given to the player solely from the linear story that the player progresses through in the game. The player learns this information about the Atlas from the interactions that the player has with it in Atlas interfaces and through the interactions with NPCs in the main storyline.
			</p>
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				However, the story of the Atlas is additionally complemented by other elements in the game outside of the interactions of the player with Atlas interfaces and NPCs in the main storyline. Through interactions with NPCs in general, the player learns of the presence of the Atlas as a god to certain races and a false god to others. Additionally, one potential space encounter that can occur randomly is finding an entity called “Messager of Atlas.” Upon finding this encounter, the player will receive a communication from it. This not only highlights the Atlas as an omnipresent entity but also shows that the Atlas wishes to communicate with the player.
			</p>
			
			<h1 class="display-6 text-light">II. The First Spawn</h1>
			
			<hr class="text-light" />
			<img src="FirstSpawn.jpg" class="w-100" alt="A picture of a giant broken structure in space, blue light emanating from a center structure in the form of a head." />
			<p class="w-100 fs-5 text-light">A Space Encounter called "Rubble of the First Spawn"</p>
			<hr class="text-light" />

			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
			The story of the First Spawn is something that is briefly touched upon during the end of the main storyline of the game. However, there are other places in the game where the First Spawn are highlighted and there are different mediums in which the information is given. For context, the First Spawn is a group of Gek that attempted to dominate and take over the galaxy, and in their takeover, they committed genocide and enslaved the Korvax (Mckeown, 2022). 
			</p>
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
			The primary story of the First Spawn can be found through records found at Ancient Ruins where Geks used to live. Finding these ruins and interacting with the plaques tells the story of the First Spawn through text snippets that add up to a cohesive story.
			</p>
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Outside of the ancient ruins though, the story of the First Spawn is still visible throughout the universe of No Man’s Sky. One random space encounter that can occur is finding the “Rubble of the First Spawn,” a giant broken structure that contains a gek head statue in the center. While the rubble functionally does nothing, its existence and visuals further push the tone of the First Spawn believing they were the supreme species and should dominate the galaxy. Also, the audio that plays when encountering the Rubble of the First Spawn sets a eery atmosphere.
			</p>
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Additionally, in NPC interactions, there are slight hints that mention the existence of the First Spawn within the Gek. Specifically that there still exists Gek that are part of the First Spawn that could one day return.
