			No Man’s Sky is specifically interesting because most of the different methods that it uses to tell its stories are procedural. There is no specific environment that the developers put into the game that is used to tell the story. Instead, the developers defined rules for how the universe is built such as how structures are made, how dialogue is written, and how events in the universe randomly occur. From there, the story of the universe is told to players through a specific instance of what those rules create in the universe. Each player has their own unique experience and telling of the story of the game, and yet, all players experience the same overarching story of the universe that the developers of the game created. While at a base level, many pieces of the storyline are static and written completely by the developers, the medium through which the story is told is dynamic and never exactly the same.

			<hr class="text-light" />
			
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				One of the immediately visible instances of the dynamic story-telling of No Man’s Sky is through the Ancient Ruins that are found throughout the universe of the game. Ancient Ruins are physical structures that the player can interact with and explore that tell the story of the civilization who built them. The visual element tells a story of a civilization that once lived there and eventually left, leaving behind their collective story and knowledge. Alongside this, there are many elements to interact with at the site. One of the most important parts of certain ruins is the plaque at the center of them. When interacting with a plaque, the game will show text dialogue to the player that tells part of the story of the civilization that built the ruins. Overall, these interactive visual and textual elements to tell the story of the species that built the ruins constitutes multimedia.
			</p>

			<h1 class="display-6 text-light">II. NPC Interactions</h1>
			<hr class="text-light" />
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				NPCs (non-player characters) in No Man’s Sky generally are a member of one of the four races in the game: Gek, Korvax, Vykeen, and Travellers. The player is a traveller, and as such, they know the language of the travellers. However, at the beginning of the game, the player does not know the language of the other three races. Through the interaction of the player with structures called “knowledge stones” and with NPCs of the three races, the player is able to learn words in the language of the other races, which the game then uses to autotranslate their languages into English. This interaction to learn the languages of the other three races and the dialogue that is received from interacting with NPCs once their language is learned adds to No Man’s Sky’s attributes as a multimedia artifact. 
			</p>
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
			Plus, because interacting with a race or a race's structures is required to learn the language, the more that one is able to understand of their language, the more the player understands the context of the race itself from their overall knowledge they have learned about them.
			</p>

			<h1 class="display-6 text-light">III. Space Encounters</h1>
			<hr class="text-light" />
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Space encounters in No Man’s Sky are random events that occur whenever a player is flying through space using a pulse engine. They contribute to No Man’s Sky as a multimedia artifact through the visual and interactive elements that they add to showcase the specific objects that exist in the universe of No Man’s Sky.

			<h1 class="display-6 text-light">IV. Derelict Freighters</h1>
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Derelict freighters are a specific type of space encounter that are specifically noteworthy because they contain their own self-contained procedurally-generated story of a freighter in which some travesty occurred that resulted in it becoming derelict. Upon landing in the freighter, the player can enter into it and advance through procedurally-generated floors to explore the ship. While doing so, they can find logs that contain information about what happened to the ship in its last moments. This gives players both textual information about what happened to the ship while simultaneously giving them first-hand experience of what happened through interacting with the remaining ship that was overtaken.
			</p>
			
			<h1 class="display-6 text-light">V. Linear Story</h1>
			
			<hr class="text-light" />
			<img src="AtlasInterface.jpg" class="w-100" alt="Image of the inside of a gray and red structure with a large red circular object front and center with a straight path leading towards it" />
			<p class="w-100 fs-5 text-light">The inside of an Atlas Interface</p>
			<hr class="text-light" />
			
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				While the other elements that have been discussed are independent elements that the player randomly encounters throughout their exploration of the universe of No Man's Sky, the storyline of No Man's Sky is a path that showcases the main story of the game in a traditional, linear fashion. The game utilizes many procedurally-generated interactable devices in order to tell the story. Upon interacting with specific devices when instructed, dialogue for the current part of the story is written using text to the user. Depending on the circumstances, there are many different visual contexts that are also included. 
			</p>
			<p class="fs-5 text-light">
				Specifically, when interacting at a “holo terminus” structure, the person that the player is speaking to displays as a hologram in front of them, giving the player a visual of who they are talking to. Then, when the player is at an Atlas Interface, the large structure surrounding them, with a monumental red entity towering over them changes the tone to be mysterious and can make the player feel small and insignificant.
