			<hr />
			
			<p>
			No Man’s Sky is specifically interesting to me because each of the different methods that it uses to tell its stories are procedural. There is no specific environment that the developers put into the game that is used to tell the story. Instead, the developers defined rules for how the universe is built such as how structures are made, how dialogue is written, and how events in the universe randomly occur. From there, the story of the universe is told to players through a specific instance of what those rules create in the universe. Each player has their own unique experience and telling of the story of the game, and yet, all players experience the same overarching story of the universe that the developers of the game created. While at a base level, many pieces of the story are static and written completely by the developers, the medium through which the story is told is dynamic and never exactly the same.

			<h1 class="display-6">I. Ancient Ruins</h1>
			<p>
				One of the immediately visible instances of the dynamic story-telling of No Man’s Sky is through the Ancient Ruins that are found throughout the universe of the game. Ancient Ruins are physical structures that the player can interact with and explore that tell the story of the civilization who built them. The visual element tells a story of a civilization that once lived there and eventually left, leaving behind their collective story and knowledge. Alongside this, there are many elements to interact with at the site. One of the most important parts of certain ruins is the plaque at the center of them. When interacting with a plaque, the game will show text dialogue to the player that tells part of the story of the civilization that built the ruins. Overall, these interactive visual and textual elements to tell the story of the species that built the ruins constitutes multimedia.
			</p>

			<h1 class="display-6">II. NPC Interactions</h1>
			<p>
				NPCs (non-player characters) in No Man’s Sky generally consist of one of the four races in the game: Gek, Korvax, Vykeen, and Travellers. The player is a traveller, and as such, they know the language of the travellers. However, at the beginning of the game, the player does not know the language of the other three races. Through the interaction of the player with structures called “knowledge stones” and with NPCs of the three races, the player is able to learn words in the language of the other races, which the game then uses to autotranslate their languages into English. This interaction to learn the languages of the other three races and the dialogue that is received from interacting with NPCs once their language is learned adds to No Man’s Sky’s attributes as a multimedia artifact.
			</p>

			<h1 class="display-6">III. Space Encounters</h1>
			<p>
				Space encounters in No Man’s Sky are random events that occur whenever a player is flying through space using a pulse engine. They contribute to No Man’s Sky as a multimedia artifact through the visual and interactive elements that they add to showcase the lore of No Man’s Sky.

			<h1 class="display-6">IV. Derelict Freighters</h1>
			<p>
				Derelict freighters are a specific type of space encounter that are specifically noteworthy because they contain their own self-contained procedurally-generated story of a freighter in which some travesty occurred that resulted in it becoming derelict. Upon landing in the freighter, the player can enter into it and advance through procedurally-generated floors to explore the ship. While doing so, they can find logs that contain information about what happened to the ship in its last moments.
